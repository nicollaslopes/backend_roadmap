# OAuth

OAuth is _not_ an API or a service: it’s an open standard for authorization and anyone can implement it. More specifically, OAuth is a standard that apps can use to provide client applications with “secure delegated access”. OAuth works over HTTPS and authorizes devices, APIs, servers, and applications with access tokens rather than credentials.

## SAML

SAML is basically a session cookie in your browser that gives you access to webapps. It’s limited in the kinds of device profiles and scenarios you might want to do outside of a web browser.
