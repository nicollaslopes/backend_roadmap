# NoSQL vs SQL

When we talk about SQL Databases, we have to mention about NoSQL. In short, NoSQL is a database that doesn't use SQL (Structured Query Language). Each NoSQL has its own way of writing and executing queries. For exemple, MongoDB uses MQL (MongoDB Query Language).

While most relational databases are very similar, NoSQL databaes tend to be very unique and are used for more specific purposes. 

* SQL Databases examples: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, SQLServer, etc.
* NoSQL Databases examples: MongoDB, Redis, ElasticSearc, etc.
