# Caching

Caching is a technique used in computing to store and retrieve frequently accessed data quickly, reducing the need to fetch it from the original, slower source repeatedly. It involves keeping a copy of data in a location thatâ€™s faster to access than its primary storage. Caching can occur at various levels, including browser caching, application-level caching, and database caching. It significantly improves performance by reducing latency, decreasing network traffic, and lowering the load on servers or databases.
