# CDN

A content delivery network (CDN) is a distributed group of serves that cache content close to end users. A CDN allows for the quick transfer of assets needed for loading Internet content, including HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, images and videos.

A CDN helps cache content at the network edge but does not host content and can not replace the need for proper web hosting. Many websites struggle to have their performance needs met by traditional hosting services, which is why they opt for CDNs.
