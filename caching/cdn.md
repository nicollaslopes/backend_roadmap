# CDN

A content delivery network (CDN) is a distributed group of serves that cache content close to end users. A CDN allows for the quick transfer of assets needed for loading Internet content, including HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, images and videos.

A CDN helps cache content at the network edge but does not host content and can not replace the need for proper web hosting. Many websites struggle to have their performance needs met by traditional hosting services, which is why they opt for CDNs.

## What are the benefits of using a CDN?

* **Improving website load times** - By distributing content closer to website visitors by using a nearby CDN server (among other optimizations), visitors experience faster page loading times.
* **Reducing bandwidth costs** - Bandwidth consumption costs for website hosting is a primary expense for websites. Through caching and other optimizations, CDNs are able to reduce the amount of data an origin server must provide, thus reducing hosting costs for website owners.
* **Increasing content availability and redundancy** - Large amounts of traffic or hardware failures can interrupt normal website function. Thanks to their distributed nature, a CDN can handle more traffic and withstand hardware failure better than many origin servers.
*  **Improving website security** - A CDN may improve security by providing [DDoS mitigation](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/ddos-mitigation/) improvements to security certificates, and other optimizations.
