# Introduction

Docker is really useful for making our local environment is as close as possible to the production environment that we're going to deploy to. Containers exist to simplify the creation of a development and production environment, making it easier to create this environment independent of the operating system and library. It is also possible to have different versions of a given language, database, etc.
